# 1. Introduction
In this document you will find an assignment for the Full Stack Developer position at [anch.AI](https://anch.ai/).
# 2. Goal
At the end of the assignment you will be creating minimum 2 webpages where in:-

1. You should create a table containing the necessary information and executed in a design style in accordance with the mockup(atached). You will be creating a webpage and visualising data stored in the [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) database.
2. On the second webpage, you are free to show us your visualization skills. We expect you to do some nice plots(spider, donut). We also expect the visulization to be interactive with filters.   
# 3. Assignment
Create minimum 2 webpage utilizing [Angular](https://angular.io/) framework.

1. Get access to the Azure database and extract the information that should be shown in the table:
- First name
- Last name 
- Email
- Job title
- Organization Unit
- Role

2. Make design of the table in accordance to the mockup.

3. Create filters that can sort the information in the table:
- Organization -> sort by Organization name
- Job title -> sort by Job title name
- Role -> sort by Role name

4. Create a search bar to filter the content in the table by Name or Email address.

5. Visualise the number of 'Total users', 'Admin', and 'Self Users'.

6. Use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) library for any visuals that you want to create.
